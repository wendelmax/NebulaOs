# NebulaOS Sovereignty Statement

## 1. Principles of Digital Sovereignty
NebulaOS is built on the principle that digital infrastructure is essential public utility. Sovereignty in this context means:
- **Data Sovereignty:** Data residency and processing are strictly controlled by the tenant within their jurisdictional boundaries.
- **Operational Sovereignty:** The ability to run, modify, and migrate the system without external approval or dependency on a single vendor's API.
- **Software Sovereignty:** Full access to source code and build pipelines, preventing "black-box" implementations.

## 2. Independence from Vendor Lock-In
NebulaOS achieves independence through its abstraction layer. By standardizing the interface for Compute, Storage, and Networking, it allows users to:
- Move workloads between local Proxmox clusters and public providers.
- Swap underlying storage backends (e.g., Ceph to S3) without re-architecting applications.
- Maintain a consistent IAM and Security policy across hybrid environments.

## 3. Public Sector Alignment
NebulaOS is designed to meet the rigorous compliance and security standards of governments and non-profits. It provides the "Sovereign Middle Path" – the efficiency of the cloud with the control of local hosting.
