# NebulaOS Open Governance Model

## 1. Governance Principles
NebulaOS belongs to the community. Its governance model is designed to be:
- **Transparent:** All architectural decisions and roadmaps are public.
- **Meritocratic:** Contribution leads to influence in the project direction.
- **Institutional:** Structured to allow participation from governments and universities.

## 2. Community Structure
- **Technical Steering Committee (TSC):** Oversees architectural integrity and core development.
- **Maintainers:** Manage specific modules (IAM, UI, Abstraction Layer).
- **Working Groups:** Focused on specific integrations (e.g., "Proxmox Provider Group").

## 3. Decision-Making Process
NebulaOS follows an RFC (Request for Comments) process for major changes. Decisions are made through consensus when possible, with the TSC serving as the final arbiter for technical disputes.

## 4. Institutional Participation
We encourage governments and nonprofits to join as "Anchor Partners," providing resources and feedback to ensure the project remains aligned with public sector needs.
