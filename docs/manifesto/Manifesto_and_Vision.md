# NebulaOS Manifesto & Vision

## 1. Vision Statement
To empower every nation, institution, and individual with the digital sovereignty to build, manage, and scale their own cloud infrastructure without dependency on proprietary vendors or foreign jurisdictions.

## 2. Mission
To provide a modular, vendor-neutral Cloud Operating System that abstracts the complexity of modern infrastructure, delivering a premium user experience while maintaining the rigorous control required for institutional and governmental operations.

## 3. Problem Statement
Modern cloud infrastructure is dominated by a few global providers, leading to vendor lock-in, data sovereignty risks, and escalating costs. Governments and public institutions lack a viable, sovereign alternative that offers the same level of automation and ease of use as commercial public clouds. NebulaOS exists to bridge this gap.

## 4. Core Values
*   **Absolute Sovereignty:** Control remains with the owner, from the hardware to the data layer.
*   **Open Source Purity:** 100% open source under permissive licenses to ensure transparency and longevity.
*   **Vendor Neutrality:** Agnostic to underlying providers (Proxmox, AWS, Bare Metal).
*   **Modular Architecture:** Components can be swapped, extended, or replaced without breaking the system.
*   **Security by Design:** Institutional-grade security and auditing as a first-class citizen.

## 5. Why NebulaOS Exists
NebulaOS is the "Cloud Abstraction Layer" for a multi-polar digital world. It is the bridge between raw infrastructure and higher-level applications, ensuring that the software stack governing our digital lives is as open as the internet was meant to be.

## 6. Strategic Positioning
Unlike AWS, Azure, or GCP, NebulaOS does not sell infrastructure; it provides the software to *orchestrate* it. It positions itself as the sovereign alternative to public clouds, offering the same convenience but on the user's terms and in their preferred jurisdiction.
